Walker recently joined the lab as a Ph.D. student with co-advisment from [Dr. Trevor Rife](https://www.rifelab.org). 
His M.S. work consisted of studying the physiological and lipid-metabolism related responses to heat-stress in peanut (*Arachis hypogaea*). 
Walker has a strong background in molecular biology techniques, management of greenhouse systems, plant pathology, & crop physiology. 
In the Hershberger lab, he will conduct research projects that further the breeding of new varieties of lima bean (*Phaseolus lunatus*) that meet both grower and consumer demands.
