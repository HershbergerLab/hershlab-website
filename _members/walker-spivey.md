Walker recently completed his M.S. and is joining the lab as a Ph.D. student with co-advisment from [Dr. Trevor Rife] (https://www.rifelab.org). His M.S. work consisted of studying the physiological and lipid-metabolism related responses to heat-stress in peanut (Arachis hypogaea). Walker brings a unique set of skills and knowledge to the lab which includes molecular biology techniques, management of greenhouse systems, plant pathology, & crop physiology. In the Hershberger lab, Walker will conduct research projects that focus on breeding new varieties of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) which meet both grower and consumer demands.
