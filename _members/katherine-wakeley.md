Hi, I’m a new PhD student looking to assess the relationship between beans (common bean, lima bean, etc.) and Anthacnose (*Colletotrichum lindemuthianum* and *C. truncatum*).
My current focus is characterizing bean anthracnose in South Carolina.
Future projects will likely include understanding the pathogenesis of bean anthracnose and understanding how anthracnose survives on plant material in the soil. 

I attended the University of Georgia (UGA) from 2012 to 2018 where I received a B.A. and a M.S. in Food Science.
My master’s thesis was completed under Dr. Ynes Ortega at the UGA's Griffin campus.
We worked on validating the efficacy of a cheaper, in-field sampling method for *Cryptosporidium spp.*, *Giardia spp.*, and *Cyclospora cayetanensis* on berry farms.
My previous career experience includes sausage and bottled water quality assurance at the technician and managerial levels. 

When I'm not working at the Pee Dee REC, I like to spend time cuddling with my cats, Lucy and Grace, reading a good fantasy book, or puttering around in my garden.
