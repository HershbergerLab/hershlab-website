Jenna received her B.S. in horticulture from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and completed her Ph.D. in Plant Breeding and Genetics with Professor Mike Gore at Cornell University in the summer of 2021. Her dissertation research focused on the genetics, genomics, and transcriptomics of sweet corn nutritional quality traits and the development of near-infrared spectroscopy-based approaches and analysis tools for the phenotyping of quality traits in cassava.

Most recently, Jenna was a postdoctoral associate with [Dr. Allison Miller](https://www.perennialplantdiversity.org) at the [Donald Danforth Plant Science Center](https://www.danforthcenter.org) and Dr. Brandon Schlautman at [The Land Institute](https://landinstitute.org), where her research focused on the development and evaluation of new selection and evaluation methods for practical application in domestication breeding programs.
