# <i class="fas fa-carrot"></i>Vegetable Breeding and Genetics Research

As the world's food supply faces the dual threats of population growth and climate change, many have rallied around a call for increased productivity and plant resiliency. While this need is indisputably clear, focusing solely on quantity omits an aspect essential to true food security â€“ quality. To holistically meet the dietary needs of nine billion people in the next thirty years, improved crop varieties must adhere to consumer preferences and provide adequate quantities of micronutrients.

But what makes a vegetable high quality, and how might this assessment differ across stakeholder groups? What is the genetic control of good flavor? How might available genetic resources be used to improve quality both efficiently and effectively?

Using tools from genomics, proximal sensing, and computer programming, the Hershberger lab seeks to explore these questions while breeding flavorful and nutritionally dense vegetables at Clemson University.
