# The Hershberger lab joins SweetCAP

The Sweet Corn Coordinated Agriculture Project ([SweetCAP](https://www.sweetcorndevelopment.org/sweet-cap.html)), is a USDA NIFA-funded, multi-institution and multi-disciplinary effort to support sweet corn improvement across the US. Earlier this year, a second iteration of SweetCAP was selected for funding through the Specialty Crop Research Initiative.

Throughout the project, the Hershberger lab will work closely with Dr. Marcio Resende and his [University of Florida sweet corn breeding program](https://www.resendelab.com/) to develop and test genomic and phenomic resources and tools for use by the wider sweet corn community.

This week, the SweetCAP team met in person at the [International Sweet Corn Development Association](https://www.sweetcorndevelopment.org) annual meeting in West Palm Beach, Florida, to share research updates, tour a field site and packaging facility, and hear from stakeholders.

We will soon be recruiting a postdoc for this project, so please reach out if you are interested in joining the team!
