# Tyler Williams joins the lab as a Research Specialist

[Tyler](team) received his B.S. in Biology from Francis Marion University in Florence, South Carolina. Most recently, Tyler was an Agricultural Research Assistant with the USDA and Clemson at the Pee Dee REC. Over the past year, he has gained experience in fieldwork, lab-based, and plant breeding activities.

Tyler hit the ground running in the middle of field season and is quickly learning the ropes. We're glad to have him on board!
